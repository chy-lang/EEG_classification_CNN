# EEG_classification_CNN
This is the first CNN network I worked on. My teammate developed the structure. I later applied the knowledge I learned in this project into the task CNN_Classification, which I have uploaded onto github.

The model of inception and resnet was adopted, which significantly improved the performance of the net.
